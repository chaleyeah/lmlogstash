# This file translates the device names of the Nutanix cluster into a hostname that the system will automatically recognize. 
# The device names may need to be updated if the cluster's primary node changes. 
# This file is formatted in YAML, so the first item in the list is the original name and the item after the ":" is the translation target. 
# The translation target is the lm_property that is configured in the 03-nutanix-lmlogs.conf file. 
# The CVMs are a solid place to start, note also that you will want to add the hostnames of the AHV or ESXi systems, and the storage VMs as well. 
# In this example ntnx-######-@-cvm is the system.sysname of the nutanix cluster added into LogicMonitor. 
# If you use a different lm_property you'll use a different translation target. 
# Below is an example of how the config would look.

NTNX-DEVICEID-CVM: ntnx-######-@-cvm
Nutanix-Hostname: ntnx-######-@-cvm
Nutanix-Storage-VM: ntnx-######-@-cvm
